# AdvancedMapping
Sometimes when I'm running a particularly complex routine I am left wondering if my code is running ok but taking a while or if I already made another clusterfuck of shitty code and it's completely stuck. I made this package to help me deal with that anxiety.

This package provides Map and Table functions with automatic progress bar, so you can rest easy knowing that it's not your code that it sucks, it's just the Wolfram kernel taking its time.

So instead of a blank notebook with a running label you get this

Here is a full description of all the functions implemented in this package:

Feel free to contribute or improve the package.
